### Welcome to my Supplementaries GitHub page.

Supplementaries is a highly configurable Forge mod focused on adding valuable content which fills the gaps vanilla has. Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.

If you are a developer reading some of my code I apologise in advance, some parts might be a bit... messy lol.
