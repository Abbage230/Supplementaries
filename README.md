### Welcome to my Supplementaries GitHub page.

If you're reading my code and you're a developer I apologise for some of the messy and convoluted parts of it XD. Keep In mind that I'm still a beginner when it comes to modding Minecraft.
If you like the project and you would like to contribute you can sumbit a PR or message me on curseforge to let me know how you would have coded a certain part of if you feel some code could be improved/made more performant.
