* Antique ink can be applied to written books turning them into Tattered books (thanks to artkek for gui texture)
* Tattered books have unique textures and cant be duplicated. They also use the antiquable font
* Weathered maps have a unique texture too
* Written and Writable books are now placed vertically instead of horizontally
* You can now pick up a placed book by shift clicking on it
* Fixed a bug where crossbows rope arrows wouldnt have their custom texture
* Fixed some JEI recipes
