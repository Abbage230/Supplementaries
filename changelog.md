- fixed an issue with creative tabs not accounting for mods that didnt add a hanging sign for their wood (bad)
- big notice board cleanup. They now use 3 blockstates instead of tile data making them more responsive
- Notice boards can accept glow ink and antique ink like any other sign
- All mod signs  + hanging signs now display text with proper shading, fixing a vanilla issue. This means that text color on signs wont always be the same and will vary just like blocks vary their shade depending on orientation
- Ill patch normal signs later
- added a config to disable notice board gui as it kind of doesnt need it
- fixed blackboard colors in inventory
